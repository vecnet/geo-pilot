# Geoblacklight

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geoblacklight/geoblacklight.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geoblacklight/geoblacklight) | [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/geoblacklight/geoblacklight.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/geoblacklight/geoblacklight?branch=coveralls)

GeoBlacklight is a world-class discovery platform for geospatial (GIS) holdings. It
is an open collaborative project aiming to build off of the successes
of the Blacklight Solr-powered discovery interface and the
multi-institutional OpenGeoportal federated metadata sharing
communities. We are currently in a collaborative design phase and
we're actively looking for community input and development partners.
More coming soon!

## Development

To install a development instance of GeoBlacklight follow these instructions.

Clone the repository (using `--recurse`)

    git clone --recurse git@github.com:geoblacklight/geoblacklight.git

Download and configure `jetty` to run Solr

    rake jetty:download jetty:unzip
    rake geoblacklight:configure_jetty

Create a test app (created at `/spec/internal`)

    rake engine_cart:generate

Boot `jetty`

    rake jetty:start

Boot GeoBlacklight test app

    cd spec/internal
    rake geoblacklight:solr:seed # to load sample documents into jetty Solr instance
    rails server

Note that if you're using Rails with Spring enabled, we've found the the `rails generate` commands
will stall. The workaround is to kill the spring daemon process. You will will probably not need to run this generator regularly.

Run tests

    rake ci

## Installation

To bootstrap a new GeoBlacklight Rails application

    $ rails new app-name -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight/master/template.rb
    
To install Solr (with jetty)

    $ cd app-name
    $ rake jetty:download
    $ rake jetty:unzip
    $ rake geoblacklight:configure_jetty
    

## Usage

For a non-development instance:

1. Populate a Solr 4.7 index with geoblacklight-schema documents
2. Configure your GeoBlacklight application's `config/solr.yml` to point to the Solr index
3. Configure your `config/environments` and `app/controllers/catalog_controller.rb`
4. `rails server` to run GeoBlacklight

## Contributing

1. Fork it ( http://github.com/my-github-username/geoblacklight/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
